Question 1: There are different interpretations of artificial intelligence in different contexts. Please elaborate on the artificial intelligence in your eyes.

Answer: 
  - From my perspective, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a product of humankind that has been being built and developed from the datas and algorithms for computers and machines imitating the human's intelligence for solving the problems, forecasting or giving the recommendation to people

Question 2: Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are three concepts often mentioned together. What is the relationship between them? What are the similarities and differences between the three terms?

Answer:
  - Deep learning is a part of machine. Likewise, machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence. Enventually, artificial intelligence is a general concept
  - Similarities: 
      + They all need the big amount of data to develop
      + They are created so as to help and improve the human's life
  - Differences:
      + Aritifical Intelligence: Ability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior
      + Machine Learning: Using algorithms to automatically learn and improve from experience
      + Deep learning: Using complex algorithms and deep neutral nets to train a model 

Question 3: After reading the artificial intelligence application scenarios in this chapter, please describe in detail a field of AI application and its scenarios in real life based on your own life experience.

Answer:
  - Virtual Assisstant such as Siri or Google Assistant will have more accurate answers like chatbot GPT. It is more interesting if there is a virtual assisstant talking to us with the correct answer similar to a communication between people.

Question 4: Which chip is for deep neural networks and Ascend AI processors. Please brief these four major modules.

Answer: 
  - Deep neural networks and Ascend AI processors require the chips which obtains CPU(Central processing unit), GPU(Graphics processing unit), ASIC (Application specific integrated circuit), FPGA (Field programmable gate array) such as InTel Core, Apple Bionic etc
    
    -**CPU:**
    * Low compute density
    * Complex control logic
    * Large caches(L1$/L2$, etc.)
    * Optimzed for serial operations
      . Fewer execution units (ALUs)
      . Higher clock speeds
    * Shallow pipelines (<30 stages)
    * Low Latency Tolerance
    * Newer CPUs have more parallelism
   
    -**GPU:**
    * High compute density
    * High Computations per Memory Access
    * Built for parallel operations
      . Many parallel execution units (ALUs)
      . Graphics is the best known case of parallelism
    * Deep pipelines (hundreds of stages)
    * High Throughout
    * High Latency Tolerance
    * Newer GPUs:
      . Better flow control logic (becoming more CPU-like)
      . Scatter/Gather Memory Access
      . Don't have one-way pipelines anymore
      

Question 5: Based on your current knowledge and understanding, please elaborate on the development trends of artificial intelligence in the future in your view.

Answer: 

  - In the future, the trend of AI will develop more and more advance than it is now. There will be some problems that will be solved by AI exclusively. However, AI is still a tool for helping and improving the human's life and never replace the man's intelligence
