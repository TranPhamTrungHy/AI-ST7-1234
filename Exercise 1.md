Question 2: Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are three concepts often mentioned together. What is the relationship between them? What are the similarities and differences between the three terms?

Answer:
  - Deep learning is a part of machine. Likewise, machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence. Enventually, artificial intelligence is a general concept

      + They are created so as to help and improve the human's life
  - Differences:
      + Aritifical Intelligence: Ability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior
      + Machine Learning: Using algorithms to automatically learn and improve from experience
      + Deep learning: Using complex algorithms and deep neutral nets to train a model 

Question 3: After reading the artificial intelligence application scenarios in this chapter, please describe in detail a field of AI application and its scenarios in real life based on your own life experience.

Answer:
  - Virtual Assisstant such as Siri or Google Assistant will have more accurate answers like chatbot GPT. It is more interesting if there is a virtual assisstant talking to us with the correct answer similar to a communication between people.
